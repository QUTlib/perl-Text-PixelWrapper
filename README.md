    * *tab* => number of space characters that matches one tab-stop

**Returns:** the length of `$string`, in pixels

### Text::PixelWrapper::dimensions( $string, %opts )

**Parameters:**

* `$string` the string to measure

    * *line* => height of a line, in ems (default = `1.2`)

**Returns:** `($width, $height)`


### Text::PixelWrapper::wrap( $string, $width=936, %opts )

Wrap a string at certain pixel-widths.

Some arbitrary widths:
* 936 = 72 'W's (widest character)
* 960 = 72 em

**Parameters:**

* `$string` the string to chop
* `$width`  how wide to chop it (default = 936, which is 72 'W's)
* `%opts`
    * *br* => what to put between the wrapped lines (default = `"\n"`)
    * *html* => 1/0 whether to compress whitespace HTML-style
